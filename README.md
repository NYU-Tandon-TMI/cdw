# cdw machine reading

"cdw machine reading" leverages Document AI's integrated OCR technology to directly extract essential information from PDF documents, enabling the visualization of transportation routes for the recycling of building materials using the Streamlit library.

## Preprocessing
This project addresses the challenge of extracting data from PDFs that feature complex layouts and diverse data presentations. Utilizing the advanced OCR capabilities inherent in Document AI, our system can accurately parse and extract pertinent information, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of data processing without relying solely on traditional OCR methods.

## Features
- **Advanced Data Extraction**: With Document AI's OCR technology, the system parses PDFs to extract key data points effectively.
- **Seamless Data Integration**: After extraction, data is seamlessly integrated, setting the stage for effective visualization.
- **Interactive Route Visualization**: Using Streamlit, the project offers mapping and visualization of recycling transportation routes.
- **CRUD Operations through Web Interface**: The application features a Streamlit-based web interface that allows for comprehensive data management through CRUD operations.
- **Detailed Custom Reporting**: The system provides tools for users to create in-depth, customizable reports that enhance informed decision-making in recycling logistics.

## Current Progress
**Rui Xue (Introduction):** Try building a better project page with github pages. Having some difficulties with it so far with Jekyll-theme.
**Yanfeng Xu (Dashboard):** Work on the dashboard building and CDW flows mapping. The previous team's chart relied on manually processed and cleaned data, unlike ours.
**Tianyi Wu (File Upload):** Test Gemini+Google Map method. An update is expected to be made within a few days.
**Ruoan Ni (Database):**  Optimizing the dadabae page.The functionality of the interface has been initially completed.
